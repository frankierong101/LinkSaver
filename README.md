# LinkSaver

LinkSaver is a simple Python script that tracks the website you're on and records any changes to the URL in a `tracked_url.txt` file.  

## Why I Made This  

I created this for a video game that uses a "seed" system, where the seed value changes based on my actions. The website I use tracks these changes, allowing me to analyze and influence outcomes.  

For example, one seed-tracking link looks like this:  
[https://bc.godfat.org/?seed=2863890737&event=2025-02-22_959](https://bc.godfat.org/?seed=2863890737&event=2025-02-22_959)  
(The seed updates whenever you click on a cat.)  

## How to Use  

1. **Clone the repository** into an empty folder:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/LinkSaver.git
   cd LinkSaver
